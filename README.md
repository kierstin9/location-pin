# pin-it

Pin-It is an experiment from the Locale Scout [http://www.localescout.com] team in an attempt at creating a useful interplay between off-chain and on-chain activity and utility for location scouts.

By using various smart contract invocations to create a location pin, we hope to create an ownable but crowd-sourced way of creating a centralized and shared location management repository for the film and entertainment industry.

Once a user uploads an initial location pin, the pin will be associated with their unique ID, and pinned to the IPFS network, allowing for additional users to access and add to the location pin data, creating a rich resource for location scouts to use in searching for film and tv productions.

By creating locations on a centralized platform that can be added to and enhanced by meta data, categorical tags, and high resolution media that comes from multiple users, we hope to create a living database that can be used both by location seekers as well as owners, creating a repository that can be used across the United States, and potentially the globe.
