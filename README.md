# Location-Pin: A proof-of-concept for a decentralized photo-location library

## Description

Location-Pin is an attempt at creating a useful interplay between off-chain and on-chain activity for the purpose of building a large photo library that could be used by location scouts.

We want to use various smart contract invocations to create content that is housed by a platform that queries off-chain APIs and appends the results with new metadata, text and image content to create a "location pin" which would be a unique identifier for a real world location, helping catalogue photos for use by users who are trying to search for imagery for use in the film and entertainment industry. We intend to do this by utilizing both pinning via our own node, as well as utilizing the IPFS network through pinning services to allow the content to be widely available.

By creating location pins on a decentralized network, users can then build and enhance the platform content by multiple users, always keeping a historical record of the location, even if the real world location changes or is destroyed. We hope in the long term to create a living usable database of location imagery that can be used by location seekers as well as location owners, creating the world's largest repository of locations that have been used in creative projects and productions.
